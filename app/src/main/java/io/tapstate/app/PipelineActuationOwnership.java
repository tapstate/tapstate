/**
 * Decides which member drives one pipeline's convergence, by holding one durable actuation claim per
 * pipeline. Every member reconciles the whole desired set, so without this each of them would drive the
 * same pipeline's lifecycle verbs: the member-local "nothing is carrying this pipeline here" check is
 * true on every member that did not submit the job, so each one starts a second run of it.
 *
 * <p>The claim is the only thing that makes a member the driver. Not the oldest member, not the job
 * coordinator, and not the lifecycle checkpoint epoch: those can land on the same node and none of them
 * is a promise. The checkpoint's compare-and-swap keeps its own job — it fences <em>actual state</em>
 * writes, and a writer that loses that race rebases onto the fresh epoch and retries, which is right for
 * a value two writers may legitimately move. Ownership is not such a value: a holder that cannot prove
 * its claim any more stops driving at once and does not rebase onto whatever the store now says, because
 * rebasing there is precisely how two members would end up driving one pipeline.
 *
 * <p>Between round trips a holder acts on the claim it last proved, for at most one renew interval —
 * shorter than the lease, so the window closes before the lease it was cut from could expire. The
 * interval is measured on the monotonic clock, so moving the node's wall clock cannot widen it.
 *
 * <p>Not synchronized: one convergence pass at a time drives this, on a single scheduler thread with a
 * fixed delay, so passes never overlap.
